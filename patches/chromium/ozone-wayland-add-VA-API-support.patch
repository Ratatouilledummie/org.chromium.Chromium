Subject: [PATCH] ozone/wayland: add VA-API support.

This patch ads VA-API support utilizing old VA-API path used for
ChromeOS, which can be buggy on some devices (currently tested
on Intel Gen8 and Gen9 with Gen8 having some minor bugs).

It's known that a new VA-API is being developed atm and once it's ready,
we will switch to a new path, which should be more stable.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate

The patch is based on the old va-api path. ChromeOS
team is working on the new path, which will be also employed
by Wayland later.
